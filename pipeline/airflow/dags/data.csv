Star Wars these days for me is just pure nostalgia and I watch once in a while just to feel good. I was lucky enough to see revenge of the sith in theaters. Even though TPM isn’t the best received by fans, if you get into legends and read about plagueis and different events around leading up and into the prequels, it makes the movies 10x more interesting. If you’re a fan of the phantom menace, go read the Darth plagueis novel ASAP. it makes TPM a monumental movie and makes you realize what’s truly going on.",2022-11-20T00:32:16Z,positive

Star Wars these days for me is just pure nostalgia and I watch once in a while just to feel good. I was lucky enough to see revenge of the sith in theaters. Even though TPM isn’t the best received by fans, if you get into legends and read about plagueis and different events around leading up and into the prequels, it makes the movies 10x more interesting.

Even though TPM isn’t the best received by fans, if you get into legends and read about plagueis and different events around leading up and into the prequels, it makes the movies 10x more interesting.

Star Wars these days for me is just pure nostalgia and I watch once in a while just to feel good. I was lucky enough to see revenge of the sith in theaters. Even though TPM isn’t the best received by fans, if you get into legends and read about plagueis and different events around leading up and into the prequels, it makes the movies 10x more interesting. If you’re a fan of the phantom menace, go read the Darth plagueis novel ASAP. it makes TPM a monumental movie and makes you realize what’s truly going on.",2022-11-20T00:32:16Z,positive
